# Agentic AI â€” Finance & Research Assistant

This is my first experiment with building an **Agentic AI system** using the [Phi framework]. The goal is to create a multi-tool assistant that can:

-  Search the web for real-time info using **DuckDuckGo**
-  Fetch stock/financial data using **YFinance**
-  Interact with users via a natural language agent


##  Features

-  Chat with an LLM-powered agent
-  Real-time web search using DuckDuckGo tool
-  Get live stock data from Yahoo Finance

## Tech Stack

- [Phi Agent Framework](https://github.com/significant-gravitas/phi)
- [Groq](https://groq.com/) (LLM API provider)
- [OpenAI](https://openai.com/)
- [YFinance](https://pypi.org/project/yfinance/)
- [DuckDuckGo Search Tool](https://github.com/deedy5/phi-tools)
- `dotenv` for environment variable management
